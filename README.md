# Problem Defination 

Why we are using e-commerce plate-form because, 
- Remote Shop deals with number of Customers.
- Every Payment is done in cash and the record is maintained in Bill Book.
- Lack of Management at times of peak seasons. 
- Sometimes customer can’t get all the detail of product due to lack of communication. 
- To check pricing difference customer has to go every shop. Which is time consuming.
- If delivery of product is late customer have to go to shop for again and again.
- Due to crowded shop and so much noise customer is not able think feely. 

# Objective
